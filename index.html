      <h1>The Chemistry Behind Airbags</h1>

    <main>
      <h1>Brief History of Airbags</h1>
      <p>
        Airbags date back to the early 1950s. In 1952, John Hetrick, an inventor
        from Detroit, Michigan, patented the first airbag design. Hetrick's
        design used a chemical reaction to inflate the airbag, but it was never
        put into production. In the 1960s, Mercedes-Benz began developing
        airbags for its vehicles. The first Mercedes-Benz with airbags was the
        1971 W116 S-Class, however airbags did not become widely available until
        the 1980s. Today airbags are standard equipment on most vehicles, they
        have been credited with saving thousands of lives. The first airbags
        were actually used in fighter jets in the 1950s. It wasn't until the
        1970s when airbags began to be used in cars.

        Airbags are a safety feature in vehicles that are designed to protect
        the driver and passengers in the event of a collision. They work by
        rapidly inflating a bag of nylon or another material that is located in
        the steering wheel, dashboard, or side of the vehicle. The airbag then
        deploys in front of the driver or passenger, cushioning their impact and
        reducing their risk of injury.
      </p>
      <h1>How's Chemistry Involved?</h1>
      <p>
        Although most people do not associate chemistry with cars, a great deal
        of chemistry occurs in them. This can range from the burning of gasoline
        to power the engine to chemical reactions in the battery to generate
        electricity. Another reaction that occurs that many people take for
        granted is the airbag. Airbags are inflated not by compressed gas but by
        the byproducts of a chemical reaction. Sodium azide, also known as NaN3,
        is a chemical that is primarily used in airbags It's a white,
        crystalline solid that, when heated, decomposes rapidly into sodium
        metal and nitrogen gas.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest advantages of using thermite for welding is its
        ability to create high temperatures, which can go up to 2500 degrees
        Celsius. This high temperature is essential for welding thick materials,
        as it makes sure that the material melts completely and fuses together.
        Thermite welding is also used in deep-sea welding as it does not require
        any external power sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under normal conditions this molecule is quite stable. If it's heated
        through it will fall apart. The chemical equation 2NaN3 â€”> 2Na + 3N2
        describes how it falls apart. Notice that the second product of the
        above reaction is N2 which is also known as nitrogen gas. A handful (130
        grams) of sodium azide will produce 67 liters of nitrogen gas which is
        enough to inflate a normal airbag.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount of sodium azide in an airbag is critical to its proper
        functioning. Too little sodium azide and the airbag will not inflate
        properly. Too much sodium azide and the airbag could deploy with too
        much force causing more harm to the driver or passenger. So basically,
        if the amount of sodium azide in an airbag is increased, the airbag will
        deploy in more force, and if the amount of sodium azide in an airbag is
        decreased the airbag will not deploy with enough force and reduce the
        effectiveness of the airbag
      </p>
      <p>
        When the airbag deploys, the sodium metal byproduct of the sodium azide
        is mixed with a small amount of potassium nitrate, which helps to slow
        the decomposition of the sodium azide and ensure that the airbag
        inflates slowly enough to protect the driver and passengers. Some
        airbags also use silicon dioxide, which, along with potassium nitrate,
        reacts with the sodium metal to form potassium silicate and sodium
        silicate, both of which prevent the sodium from reacting with moisture
        in the air to form corrosive sodium hydroxide, which can harm the eyes
        and skin.

      <p>
        It is worth noting that the other chemical into which sodium azide
        degrades is Na, also known as sodium. Because sodium is a highly
        reactive metal that quickly reacts with water to form sodium hydroxide,
        it would be extremely dangerous if it got into your eyes, nose, or
        mouth. To reduce the risk of exposure, airbag manufacturers combine
        sodium azide with other chemicals that react with the sodium to produce
        less toxic compounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        What causes an airbag to inflate as a result of this reaction? They are
        sensors in the front of the vehicle that detect collisions. These
        sensors transmit an electric signal to the canister containing the
        sodium azide, which detonates a small amount of an igniter compound. The
        heat generated by the ignition begins the decomposition of the sodium
        azide and the production of nitrogen to fill the airbag. What's amazing
        about this is that the time between when the sensor detects a collision
        and when the airbag is fully inflated is only about 30 milliseconds, or
        0.03 of a second. About 50 milliseconds after an accident, the car's
        occupant collides with the airbag, which deflates and absorbs the
        occupant's forward motion.
